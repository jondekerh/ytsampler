download and trim videos from youtube - great for sampling audio

wip - script that allows users to quickly download videos then specify timestamps to trim them down.

current only download option is mp3 tho considering youtube already compresses the shit out of audio its not like WAV files are gonna be any better

TODO includes fixing/adding interactivity to GUI, Docker shit, and overall making it easier to use esp on windows (tho thats last prio)

i made this cuz i got tired of tracking down new yt2mp3 sites and having to trim down audio manually after a download enjoy :)
